## Product Context

### Why This Project Exists

This project exists to provide an efficient and effective way for language learners to study Czech vocabulary using Anki flashcards.

### Problems It Solves

It solves the problem of manually creating flashcards, which can be time-consuming and may not always provide the necessary context for understanding the nuances of the Czech language. It also addresses the challenge of generating accurate translations and context sentences for Czech words, ensuring that learners understand all possible usages.

### How It Should Work

The project should take a list of the most frequent Czech words and automatically generate flashcards with translations, context sentences, and pronunciation audio. The generated flashcards should be easily importable into Anki for studying.

### User Experience Goals

The user experience should be seamless and intuitive. The process of generating and importing flashcards should be quick and easy, allowing learners to focus on studying rather than spending time on manual tasks. The flashcards themselves should be comprehensive and provide all the necessary information for effective learning.
